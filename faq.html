                                <p>Our team will arrive at the agreed time with our moving truck and equipment. They'll inspect your items, confirm the inventory, and begin loading carefully. We use proper techniques and padding to protect your belongings. The duration depends on the size of your move (typically 2-6 hours). Once everything is loaded, we'll transport it to your new location and unload with the same care.</p>
